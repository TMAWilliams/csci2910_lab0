# Welcome Weary Traveler
### My name is _Tessa_
#### I'll let you in on a little secret...
###### *I've never used Markdown before*
I'm ~~nervous~~ excited for **CSCI 2910**!<br>
I'm already learning so much...
## Things I've learned
### Lists
I can use Markdown to create a list of some of my **_favorite_** things...<br>
1. Photography
2. Art
3. Video Games

Or an unordered list of things I *don't* like...
 * Olives
 * Moths

---
### Tables
I've also learned you can create tables.
#### My Pets
 Dog | Cat
 :---: | :---:
 *Aleu* | *Pickles*
 *Phantom* |
 
 ***
 ### Blockquotes
 I can use Markdown to create blockquotes to share lyrics from my favorite song!
 ###### Can you name the song?
 >*"...and the piano sounds like a carnival and the microphone smells like a beer. They sit at the bar and put bread in my jar saying, 'Man what are you doing here?'"*

### Links
Here's a link to the song on spotify.<br>

### Footnotes
Markdown can do so much more than I previously thought[^1].
[^1]: Originally I thought all I could do with Markdown was change how text looked, but it turns out you can do a lot more than just making text bold or italic!

---
### Images
I learned how to add images too.<br>
*This is me!*<br>

## Things I'm Unsure About
### *Strikethroughs*
For some reason my strikethroughs will show in the editor but not the preview on GitHub.<br>
~~Maybe it will show up once I commit the changes?~~

### *Creating Markdown Files*
I was able to create a Markdown file in `GitHub`, but outside of `GitHub` I'm not sure how to create one.
